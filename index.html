          Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.

          Its a wonderful place. Must visit this place Must haired so it will be better to understand all things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different areas in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting the observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.

            In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to
            stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other
            options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company
            makes over 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO wants to replace the harmful
            plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the
            high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with
            the effective "clicking" together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured blocks

            The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer.
            However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the 
            Blazillian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and
            'below the historical average'. An international team of scientists writing in the
            Journal Globe Change Biology say the number of active fire in August was actually three
            times higher than in 2018 and the highest number till 2010.

            WhatsApp has published a blog post reminding users that they’ll eventually have
            to accept its controversial privacy update to continue using the messaging

            The platform has a new plan of asking users to review its terms of service and
            privacy policy. The Facebook-owned company said it’s now using the Status
            feature on the app to share its values and updates directly within WhatsApp.

            and we continue to work hard to clear up any confusion,” WhatsApp wrote,
            addressing the flak it received after it announced updates to its privacy policy
            in January.

            It’s no secret that WhatsApp is catching some major flak for the new changes
            to its privacy policy. You have just a few months to agree to the new terms that
            would share more of your data with parent company Facebook. As a result, many
            users are quitting the messaging app for good and searching for greener pastures. Here’s our comparison of WhatsApp vs Telegram vs Signal to help you decide where to go next.
